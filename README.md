# Horizon

This repository contains a continuation of the heavily customized F-Chat Rising, a version of the mainline F-Chat 3.0 client.

## Features

In a non-exhaustive list, F-Chat Horizon has these features!

- **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
- **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
- **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
- **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
- **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.

## Goals

Horizon aims to be an opinionated fork of F-Chat Rising. Instead of aiming solely to be a more customized fork of the original client, we aim to:

- **Maintain Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Ensure full functionality across Linux, Windows, and macOS without bias toward any specific platform.

- **Show Function Over Form**  
  Prioritize features, usability, and reliability over appearance. Adopt modern feature sets and evolving standards.

- **Be Community-Driven**  
  Foster an open, collaborative development environment guided by the community. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

- **Have Safe and High-Quality Code**  
  Enforce strict code quality standards, specifically in readability, maintainability, and safety.

- **Be Simple by Default, Powerful When Needed**  
  All additional features should be optional, and when possible, disabled by default.

- **Have a Fork-Friendly Foundation**  
  Establish a solid base that can be easily adapted for future forks with different objectives.

- **Retain Core Features**  
  Maintain _all core_ functionality from the original _Rising_ project.

It should be known that this project aligns closely with the ideaology of [KDE](https://manifesto.kde.org)

# Installing

F-Chat Horizon can be installed on all _major_ operating systems (Minus BSDs.)

## Windows

> [!NOTE]
> I, the developer of this project, do not use windows, _and thus cannot test these._ While I have no reason to believe they won't work, please [contact me](https://horizn.moe/contact.html) with any bugs.

1. Download the installer for your architecture:
   - [Windows x64](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest/download/F-Chat.Horizon-win-x64.exe)
   - [Windows arm64](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest/download/F-Chat.Horizon-win-arm64.exe)
2. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

(Maybe one day we'll support winget~)

## MacOS

> [!WARNING]
> Due to that nature of Mac, MacOS builds are **experimental**. Please [contact me](https://horizn.moe/contact.html) if you have any issues.

Since we currently don't have a paid developer license (and MacOS by default blocks unsigned apps downloaded from the internet), you may need to manually allow the app in your command line or System Settings.

1. Download the installer. This _should_ work for both M1 and Intel based systems
   - [MacOS (Universal)](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/releases/latest/download/F-Chat.Horizon-mac-universal.dmg)
2. Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the application to your Applications folder.
   If you get a warning saying `"F-Chat" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin.` while attempting to open F-Chat, continue past step 2:

3. Open the Applications folder in your finder, and hold the Ctrl key while clicking the F-Chat Horizon icon, and select "Open".
4. The warning should appear like normal, but if you then go to System Settings > Privacy and Security, F-Chat Horizon should appear as a blocked app. Clicking "Open Anyway" should add it to the whitelist and let you use it as normal.

![MacOS Ctrl-Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/refs/heads/main/docs/images/macos-whitelist-ctrl-open.png)
![MacOS System Settings Whitelist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/refs/heads/main/docs/images/macos-whitelist-settings.png)

Or if you're more of a Terminal hero:

3. Open your Terminal app
4. Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Horizon.app
```

5. Now the app should open as expected.

This is unfortunately unresolvable unless we either get a paid developer license from Apple, or if users disable the Gatekeeper whitelist from their system altogetherâ€“ which we do **not** recommend you do.

## Linux

Horizon has excellent Linux support. Read more at [horizon-packages](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/horizon-packages)

# Usage

## Getting started

When you first load F-Chat Horizon, you'll notice its interface is closely similar to the original client. However, note the added menus:

1. **Ad Editor**: Located underneath your profile, entering the Ad editor will open an additional menu. Here you can edit the ads you want to post!
   - Assign a 'tag' to your ads. You can use the 'post ads' function to post ads of specific tag types into specified channels.
2. **Post Ads**: Located under the Ad Editor, clicking this button will open the ad posting dialog. You can select the tags and channels for your ads.
3. **Settings**: Horizon adds additional settings under the settings button.
   - _The Horizon tab_: Contains general settings for Horizon
   - _The Smart Filters tab_: Here you can configure the smart filters. **Be aware that this is a work in progress!**

## Wiki

The (currently work in progress and non-existing at this current moment) wiki has additional information on using Horizon

## FAQ:

1. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Sexual preference
   - Dominance preference
   - Human/anthro preference
   - Post length preference
   - Position preference
   - Non-custom kinks
   - Species
1. Matching for non-binary genders relies on kinks. For example, if your non-binary character has a preference for females, make sure 'females' are listed as a favorite kink.
   - Similarly if you want to match with non-binary genders -- independent of your characters' gender -- add your preferred non-binary types into your kink list.
1. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kink preferences are interpreted as age difference of 8+ years.
1. Comparison results will get faster over time, as more and more character data is cached.
1. If you have a species-fluid character (e.g. you play both your character as both a human and an anthro), you can indicate this by setting your **species** in your character profile in the following ways. F-List Horizon will then score you against the best fitting type.
   - Human or tiger
   - Human, tiger, or dragon
   - Anthro (Horse or Tiger)
   - Dragon (Dwarf, Elf, or Human)
   - Elf (optionally vampire or dwarf)
   - Feline (optionally horse, tiger, or elf)
